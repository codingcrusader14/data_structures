# C++ Custom Container Library

This header only library contains all of my custom container implmentations of eventually all the data structures in the C++ STL. All containers try and use modern C++20 features such as concepts, spaceship operator and constexpr.
I also want to include certain competitive programming data structures such as union find and splay trees, this will be a incremental process for me overtime.

## Purpose

This project is primarily a learning experience for myself and people like you reading this who are just interested on how langauge features are implemented in the C++ standard.

### My Specifications

MacOS Apple Air M2 - 2022.

### Getting Started

I switch off between clang and gnu so feel free to use any C++20 standard compiler.

```bash
  -g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Werrors -o main main.cpp
```

### Comments

Eventually I'll add a CMake build, only until I add more containers down the line. If there are any bugs you could point out or any constructive criticism that you can lend me that would be wonderful.
