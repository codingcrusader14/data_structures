C++ STL Containers & Data Structures

This directory contains all of my custom container implmentations of eventually all the data structures in the C++ STL. All containers try and use modern C++20 feautres such as concepts, spaceship operator and constexpr.
I also want to include certain competitive programming data structures such as union find and splay trees, this will be a incremental process for me overtime. 

My Build & Tools
M2 - 2022 MacOS : VS code and the Helix modal editor.

Building 
To compile:
  -g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Werrors -o main main.cpp 

Eventually I'll add a CMake build, only until I add more containers down the line. Also this is a learning experience for me, if there are any bugs or constructive criticism that you could lend me that would be appreaciated.
